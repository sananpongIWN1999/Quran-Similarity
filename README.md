Subject : Data mining 
# Overview
This part of this work summarizes what I learned in the data mining section.
This is a text mining, program using a program called KNIME.By using the data 
as an Excel file in the translation section of the Holy Quran from Surah Al Fatiha, 
which includes translations from 13 recognized translators.
 1.  Abdul haleem 
 2. Pickthal 
 3.Yusuf ali 
 4.Fadel soliman 
 5.ghali 
 6.Ibu kathir 
 7.Maarif 
 8.Maulana wahiduddin khan 
 9.Mufti taqi usmani 
10.Muhammad taqi ud din al hilali amp Muhammad muhsin khan 
11.Mustafa khattab 
12.Ruwwad 
13.Tafheem adul ala maududi
And the goal of text mining is to find out how much synonyms 
in each translation have been measured as a percentage.
